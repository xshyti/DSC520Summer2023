HI all! My name is Xhoi (Joey)! I currently work as a Software Engineer and I'm based out of Chicago. I primarily work in application development but my ideal role is to be more of a data engineer/analyst. So far I'm very much enjoying this program and look forward for what's to come in this course! Nice to meet you all!!
